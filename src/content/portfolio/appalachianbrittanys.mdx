## Introduction / Overview

Appalachian Brittanys is a web project aimed at revamping the online presence of a small dog breeding service. The goal was to move away from a generic website builder to a custom, responsive design that better serves the needs and character of the service. This project served as a practice ground for web design and layout fundamentals, with a focus on utilizing modern technologies like Astro, Tailwind CSS, and building a custom component library using shadcn components.

- **Astro**: An all-in-one web framework for building fast, content-focused websites.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **shadcn Components**: Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps and build upon. For more info on shadcn, click [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
